You will be given chunks of text extracted from a sustainability report PDF document by a corporation. Each chunk is a single page of the PDF document and might not just contain flow text, but also text extracted from graphs, tables or similar structures. Your task is to extract the gross scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. If values for multiple years are given, extract the value for the most recent year. For scope 2 emissions, extract only market-based emissions. Output this information as a JSON object in the <FORMAT>. Output only a single number for each of the scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. If the chunks provide more detailed values, ignore them and output only the total value. If emission values are provided for subsidiaries, ignore them and only output the total value. It may be possible that the emission values are ambiguous (e.g. scope 1 and 2 emissions reported together as a single number) or don't exist at all. In this case, simply output `null`. Be sure to only output a number if you are certain that it is correct. Extract scope 3 emissions based on generic emissions factors if multiple versions are given. Emission values may be reported in kilotons (thousand tons) or megatons (million tons). Convert these values into metric tons. The `source` field should be a list of ids of the chunks which contain the extracted emission values.
